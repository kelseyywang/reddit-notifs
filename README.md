# Reddit Notifs

Look for posts matching some keywords and email notifications to yourself.

Make sure you include a file called secrets.py that contains the following info:

```
MY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
MY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
MY_USER_AGENT='app_name by /u/your_username'
MY_REDDIT_USERNAME='your_username'
MY_REDDIT_PASSWORD='your_password'
SENDER_EMAIL = 'sender_email'
SENDER_PASSWORD = 'sender_password'
RECEIVER_EMAIL = 'receiver_email'
```
